# Java Practice Problems

This repository has my solutions to 25 Java practice problems. Each problem is in its own class file. To make testing possible from my Terminal, I added a main method, necessary import statements, and test cases for each problem.

## Project Structure

Each problem is implemented in its own Java class file within the `src/main/java/org/example` directory. The class name corresponds to the problem name.

**_I also added my screenshot of the homepage here in the root directory, as well as on Canvas._**
